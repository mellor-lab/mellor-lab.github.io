My interest in neuroscience began in 2016 while pursuing a master’s dissertation on unconventional glycine-binding NMDAR 
receptors and their role in learning and memory formation. 
In 2018 I moved to Bristol to join for a PhD with Prof. Jeremy Henley and Prof. Jack Mellor, 
where I investigated the role of Kaintae receptors in the plasticity of AMPA receptors. 
In 2021 I joined as a post-doc 
 

### Research:
 
My research focuses the role of ion channel on the network activity of brain circuitss. I am interested in understanding
the role of GluK2 pre-mRNA editing in maintaining healthy neuronal networks and its dysfunction in neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders.

I am also interested in the role that AMPA receptor function has on eplielptogeneis.

To investigate these topics I utalise my biochemical skill-set with brain slice electrophysiology to study circuit function. 


### Current projects:

# Genetic Risk factors for schizophrenia

Schizophrenia is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder affecting ~1% of the population. It is a type of psychosis including positive and negative symptoms and is generally not diagnosed until the late teens/early 20s. Psychotherapy and some medications are available as a treatment, but they are not always effective.

Environmental and genetic underlying causes have been identified, and a research from  SCHEMA Consortium pinpointed 10 individual genes that are ultra-high risk factor, four of these being associated with synaptic calcium regulation and plasticity.

[Matt Claydon] (../our-team/members/mattclaydon), [Laura Alberio] (../our-team/members/lauraalberio), Marie Sabec and [Shyline Bajaba] (../our-team/members/shylinebajaba) are working on the project integrating in vitro and in vivo approaches.

### Aim:

:::{grid-item}

We want to assess how the stability of spatial representations and adaptive behaviour are disrupted in mice with altered expression of schizophrenia risk genes.

### Techniques:

We combine in vivo 2-photon Calcium imaging of CA1 activity with precisely defined behavioural tasks in a virtual reality system.

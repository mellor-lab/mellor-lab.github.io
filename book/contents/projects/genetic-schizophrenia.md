# Genetic Risk factors for schizophrenia

Schizophrenia is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder affecting ~1% of the population. It is a type of psychosis including positive and negative symptoms and is generally not diagnosed until the late teens/early 20s.
Psychotherapy and some medications are available as a treatment, but they are not always effective.
Environmental and genetic underlying causes have been identified, and a research from  SCHEMA Consortium pinpointed 10 individual genes that are ultra-high risk factor, 4 of these being associated with synaptic Ca2+ regulation and plasticity.


### Aim:

:::{grid-item}

We want to assess how the stability of spatial representations and adaptive behaviour are disrupted in mice with altered expression of schizophrenia risk genes.

### Techniques:

We combine in vivo 2-photon Ca2+ imaging of CA1 activity with precisely defined behavioural tasks in a virtual reality system.

# Our Projects

We have a range of ongoing projects within our group spanning from the molecular to the systems level, with collaboration a key to our success.
We utilise a range of methodologies including:
- Brain slice electrophysiology 
- 2-photon imaging in brain slices
- Behaviour in virtual reality with 2-photon imaging 
- Calcium imaging with minaturised microscopes
- Molecular Biochemistry 
- Animal behaviour
- Computational modelling

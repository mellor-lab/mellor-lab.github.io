# How we work

&nbsp;

We believe in an `open team science` approach that supports researchers to take risks and fulfil their potential. 
Within the team we operate a flat structure where all voices are equal and valued. 

We set challenging goals of each other but acknowledge that it's not always possible to achieve everything. 
We also `collaborate` with internal and external academic researchers to Bristol and with clinicians and industrial partners. 
To facilitate these collaborations we have developed a `data sharing` platform and advocate `open access` science.

## Open Science obligations

```{admonition} FIXME Instructions
Your institution's Library or Research Office can often provide support with understanding your obligations
```

### Funder requirements
Our group is funded by `<NAME OF FUNDER(S)>` under grants `<GRANT CODE(S)>`. 
Under our grant conditions we have to meet the requirements of `<FUNDER>`'s policy on open science/access. 
The full policy can be found here `<URL LINK TO POLICY>`. The policy requires `<BRIEF DETAILS OF WHAT POLICY REQUIRES, E.G. ALL PUBLICATIONS MUST BE OPEN ACCESS, DATASETS MUST BE SHARED ETC>`

### Institutional requirements
Our research must also comply with the institute's policy on open science/access. 
The full policy can be found here `<URL LINK TO POLICY>`. 
The policy requires `<BRIEF DETAILS OF WHAT POLICY REQUIRES, E.G. ALL PUBLICATIONS MUST BE OPEN ACCESS, DATASETS MUST BE SHARED ETC>`

### National requirements
Our research must also comply with the `<COUNTRY>` national policy on open science/access.

The policy requires `<BRIEF DETAILS OF WHAT POLICY REQUIRES, E.G. ALL PUBLICATIONS MUST BE OPEN ACCESS, DATASETS MUST BE SHARED ETC>`.

## Outputs
### Pre-registration
We pre-register our research on `<REGISTRY/REPOSITORY>`. 
A useful guide on pre-registration can be found on the [Center for Open Science](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/prereg?_ga=2.139416506.845472435.1633347892-837995524.1617877302).

### Protocols
We make our protocols openly available on `<PLATFORM OF CHOICE>` and cite them in our publications. 
We may also publish our protocols in peer reviewed journals.

### Datasets
Datasets that support a publication or other output should be shared unless there are ethical or legal reasons not to. 
Our group generally shares datasets in `<REPOSITORY>`.

### Code/software
Code or software that supports a publication or other output should be referenced in the published work.
A snapshot of the code/software should be archived in `<REPOSITORY>`.

### Preprints
We post preprints to `<PREPRINT SERVER>` when `<TIME POINT>`.

### Published articles

```{admonition} FIXME Instructions
Some, all or none of the following statements might be true for your group.
```

- When choosing a journal to submit to we base our decision on which is the most appropriate for our research finding. We do not take into account the journal impact factor (JIF).
- We only publish in fully open access journals or diamond journals. We do not pay for open access in hybrid journals.
- `<NAME OF FUNDER(S)>` provide funding to cover the costs of paying for open access. To utilise this funding `<INSTRUCTIONS FOR ACCESSING FUNDS>`.
- All publications should acknowledge our funding using this wording: This work was supported by `<NAME OF FUNDER>` `<GRANT CODE>`.

### Published peer review
If there is the option to make the peer review of one of our papers public, then we opt-in to having it published. 
Group members who act as peer reviews can opt-in to published peer review as they see fit.

## Authorship guidelines
Our Group uses the [CRediT](https://casrai.org/credit/) (Contributor Roles Taxonomy) terminology wherever possible.

## Licensing
Wherever possible our outputs are published under open licences. For publications etc we use `<INSERT LICENCE OF CHOICE, E.G. CC BY>`. 
For software and code, we preferrable use `<INSERT LICENCE OF CHOICE, E.G. APACHE 2.0>`.

# Group meetings

We run collaborative group meetings with the groups of Mike Ashby and Paul Anastasiades. These run on three weekly cycles and 
consist of Data presentations/ project updates, journal clubs and individual group meetings.


## Data presentations 

These are a great opportunity for researchers within the lab to share their current project progress. Typically these are 45 minute presentations
where anything goes. Data can be presented in its rawest format or as a polished project overview. The main aim of these
meeting are to get feedback from others in the lab, to help our projects advance.
 
This could include:
- project plans 
- data/ analysis problems 
- 

Logistics
- Every day at 10:00am
- Stand-up meeting in the office with tea/coffee; remote team members via a video call
- Attendance not required every day, but recommended once per week

Format
- Quick check-in from each group member, optionally sharing 'one cool thing' they found or tool they started using recently

Purpose
- Allows us to keep pace with developments in a fast-moving subject area

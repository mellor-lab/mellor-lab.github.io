# Group meetings

We run collaborative group meetings with the groups of Mike Ashby and Paul Anastasiades. These run on three weekly cycles and 
consist of Data presentations/ project updates, journal clubs and individual group meetings.


## Data presentations 

These are a great opportunity for researchers within the lab to share their current project progress. Two lab members will typically present for 45 minute presentations
where anything goes. Data can be presented in its rawest format or as a polished project overview. The main aim of these
meeting are to get feedback from others in the lab, to help our projects advance.
 
**What we present**
- Project outlines  
- data/ analysis problems 
- Finished analysed data
- Ideas for grant proposals

## Journal club

These take the format of a classic journal club. We aim to present a paper that has recently been published that we think
will be of general interest to the groups attending. 

**Purpous**
- Great opportunity to delve into the methodology 
- Gain better understanding of the topic area
- Improve critical thinking skills

These journal clubs can be used to present peer reviewed publications or publications via preprint.

## Individual group meetings

These meetings involve us meeting up as a group to discuss lab matters. These meetings can take many forms but are a great opportunity 
for us to discuss lab issues, problems that we might be facing in our projects or just a chit chat about how we are getting on. 

**What we discuss**
- Discuss what we have been working 
- Present recent findings to the group.
- Describe problems and problem solve through solutions 
- Discuss failures to normalise the pitfalls of science research


```{admonition} The unwritten rule
In general if you are presenting you have to feed the audiance by providing treats in the form of 
pasteries, cake or fruit.

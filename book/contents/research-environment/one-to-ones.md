# One-to-one Meetings


## Meeting schedule


Every group member meets with Jack Mellor for 1 hour every 2 months.
These are scheduled as recurring meetings but can be rescheduled if there is an event clash.


## Meeting purpose

#### `The general purpose of one-to-one meetings is to:`
  -  Get `support in decision-making` (within a project, or more generally, e.g. career goals)
  -  Get `feedback` on iterations of work
  -  Raise any issues, and `talk through problems`
  -  Get support in accessing support and opportunities (such as [mental health support](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/wellbeing/), [disability adjustments](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/disability-services/), PhD enrichment schemes or training).
- For managers/supervisors to:
  - Understand how work is progressing so that they can best support team members
- For both to:
  - Agree timelines and goals

#### `One-to-one meetings can also be arranged for:` 
  - grant/fellowship/conference applications 
  - practising talks/interviews (we can also do this at [group-meetings](group-meetings)
  - demonstrating technology/methods that might be useful to one-another


## Guidelines
The following guidelines exist to help us get the best out of meetings.
Individuals might agree on different format if it suits them better.

#### `The following applies to team members and supervisors:`
- If you'd like to get feedback on something at a meeting:
   - send the materials at least 1 day in advance 
   - specify particular areas that you wish them to focus on or specific questions you want answers to, e.g. "please read Chapter 3" or "does the methods section need elaborating?"
- Plan what you want to discuss in the meeting and contribute to the agenda
- Engage fully in the meeting (i.e. no other distractions such as emails)
- Have any files or materials ready to show
- When you present a problem, also attempt to find a solution.

```{note} 
One-to-one meetings aren't the only contact you'll have with the team, sometimes [group meetings](group-meetings) can be better places to get feedback from more people.

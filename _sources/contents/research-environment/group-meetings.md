# Group meetings

We run collaborative weekly meetings with the groups of Mike Ashby and Paul Anastasiades. These run on three weekly cycles and 
consist of Data presentations/project updates, journal clubs and separate group meetings.

&nbsp;

## Data presentations 

These are a great opportunity for researchers within the lab to share their current project progress. Two lab members will typically present for 45 minute presentations where anything goes. Data can be presented in its rawest format or as a polished project overview. The main aim of these
meeting are to get feedback from others in the lab, to help our projects advance.
 
**What we present:**
- Project outlines  
- data/ analysis problems 
- Finished analysed data
- Ideas for grant proposals


## Journal club

These take the format of a classic journal club. We aim to present a paper that has recently been published that we think
will be of general interest to the groups attending. 

**Purpose:**
- Great opportunity to delve into the methodology 
- Gain better understanding of the topic area
- Improve critical thinking skills

These journal clubs can be used to present peer reviewed publications or publications via preprint.


## Individual group meetings

These meetings are a chance to check in with day-to-day progress, problem solve, and keep up-to-date on individual projects and wider issues that concern the group. 

**What we discuss:**
- What we have been working on
- Present recent findings to the group.
- Describe problems and problem solve through solutions 
- Discuss failures to normalise the pitfalls of science research

```{admonition} The unwritten rule
If you are presenting you have to feed the audience by providing treats in the form of 
pastries, cake or fruit.

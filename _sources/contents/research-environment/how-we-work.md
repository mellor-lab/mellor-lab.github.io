# How we work

```{admonition} FYI Instructions
We believe in an open team science approach that supports researchers to take risks and fulfill their potential. WIthin the team we operate a flat structure where all voices are equal and valued. We set challenging goals of each other but acknowledge that its not always possible to achieve everything. We also collaborate with internal and external academic researchers to Bristol and with clinicians and industrial partners. To facilitate these collaborations we have developed a data sharing platform.

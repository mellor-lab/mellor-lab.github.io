# One-to-one Meetings

## Meeting schedule

```{admonition} FIXME Instructions

```

Every group member meets with Jack Mellor for 1 hour every 2 months.
These are scheduled as recurring meetings but can be rescheduled if there is an event clash.

## Meeting purpose
The general purpose of one-to-one meetings is for team members to:
  -  get support in decision-making (within a project, or more generally, e.g. career goals)
  -  get feedback on iterations of work
  -  raise any issues, and talk through problems
  -  get support in accessing support and opportunities (such as [mental health support](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/wellbeing/), [disability adjustments](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/disability-services/), PhD enrichment schemes or training).
- For managers/supervisors to:
  - understand how work is progressing so that they can best support team members
- For both to:
  - agree timelines and goals

Either party can also arrange for one-to-one meetings to be used for more specific purposes when needed, for example to support team members with: 
  - grant/fellowship/conference applications 
 - practising talks/interviews (we can also do this at [group-meetings](group-meetings)
- demonstrating technology/methods that might be useful to one-another

## Guidelines
The following guidelines exist to help us get the best out of meetings.
Individuals might agree on different format if it suits them better.

The following apply to both team members and managers/supervisors:
- If you'd like to get feedback on something at a meeting:
   - send the materials at least 1 day in advance 
   - specify particular areas that you wish them to focus on or specific questions you want answers to, e.g. "please read Chapter 3" or "does the methods section need elaborating?"
- Plan what you want to discuss in the meeting and contribute to the agenda
- Engage fully in the meeting (i.e. no other distractions such as emails)
- Have any files or materials ready to show
- When you present a problem, also attempt to find a solution.

```{note} Other Meetings
One-to-one meetings aren't the only contact you'll have with the team, sometimes [group meetings](group-meetings) can be better places to get feedback from more people.

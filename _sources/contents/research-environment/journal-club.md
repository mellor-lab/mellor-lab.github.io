We run a journal club where we come together as a group and discuss papers of interest. 
This club is particularly useful for early career researchers but will be of interest to everyone.
The club is informal and participation is strongly encouraged.

- Journal club is held every 3 weeks as part of our group meeting cycle.
- We discuss 1 paper each meeting and these are selected by whoever is leading the meeting.
- Papers are sent to the whole Group >3 days before the meeting and everyone is expected to have read them before the meeting.
- We take turns leading the club.

Basic rules for the meeting:
- Listen to other people.
Do not talk over people.
- Do not be afraid to voice your opinion.
This is supposed to be an informal meeting.
- Read the papers in advance.
- If you are leading the session think of some areas for discussion in advance and keep the conversation flowing.

I graduated from UCL with a MSci Natural Sciences in 2022 with a background spanning neuroscience, pharmacology, psychology, and organic chemistry. 
I join Jack Mellor's as a PhD student in 2022.

I'm fascinated by the mechanistic role that dysfunctional endocannabinoid and serotonergic signalling 
plays in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, 
and cancer; and how compounds targeting dysfunctional endocannabinoid and serotonergic 
signalling (i.e., cannabinoids and psychedelics) may prove to be breakthrough treatments for these 
debilitating disorders/diseases that currently lack efficacious pharmacotherapies.
 

### Research:

I'm currently researching the molecular and synaptic mechanisms which underlie the sustained antidepressant 
effects of NMDA receptor antagonists a project jointly supervised by Jack Mellor and Emma Robbinson.

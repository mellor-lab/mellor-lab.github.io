I completed my undergraduate degree in Neuroscience at the University of Bristol in 2018,
After which I started a Wellcome Trust Neural Dynamics PhD programme jointly supervised by Jack and Rui Ponte Costa. 

### Research:

My research interest lies in understanding how biologically inspired deep learning models learn and how their predictions can be used to guide experimental neuroscience 
in studying the brain. Specifically, I am investigating the impact of cholinergic neuromodulation on cortical microcircuits related to learning and memory. 
I have been implementing biologically plausible models of 
backpropagation to explore a role for the cholinergic system in credit assignment and have been testing these predictions using ex vivo brain slice electrophysiology.  


### Current projects:

- [Cholinergic-mediated adaptive learning in cortical microcircuits](../../projects/adaptive-learning)

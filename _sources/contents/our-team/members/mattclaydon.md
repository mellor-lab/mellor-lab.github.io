My interest in neuroscience started during my undergraduate degree at UCL, and that was furthered during my MSc in molecular neuroscience at the University of Bristol. During my MSc I got a taste for research and went on to complete a PhD investigating the effects of circadian disruption and steroid treatment using brain slice electrophysiology. I have joined Jack's lab in 2024 as a postdoc and am now investigating risk genes associated with schizophrenia.

### Research:
My research in the Mellor lab will utilise two-photon imaging of dendritic calcium, combined with whole-cell electrophysiology, to assess the convergent and divergent changes in synaptic integration and physiological properties that may arise from several high-risk genetic mutations associated with schizophrenia. I use a combination of acute brain slices and cultured organotypic human brain slices.

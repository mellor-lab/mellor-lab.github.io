### Welcome to our group webpages

[The Mellor Group](our-team/current-members) based at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/phys-pharm-neuro/) aims to understand the mechanisms of learning and memory within the hippocampus. 

We focus on the fundamental process of synaptic plasticity that shapes who we are as individuals with implications in many neurological and psychiatric disorders. 
How memory is encoded is dependent on the behavioural context of learnt information and we are interested in how this context is signalled and then incorporated into the encoding of memory by synaptic plasticity at a neuronal circuit level. 

To address these questions we use an array of technical approaches including ex vivo and in vivo electrophysiology, optogenetics and 2-photon imaging combined with behavioural assays and computational modelling.

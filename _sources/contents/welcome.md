### Why do we have a group handbook?

We have a group handbook to:
- Ensure that everyone in the group can find everything they need easily 
- Share resources with others 
- Introduce ourselves to potential collaborators and new group members
- Do our project management Openly 
- Be explicit about our roles and responsibilities
- Foster a culture of healthy working
- Help everyone to feel included in decision making and lab culture (which is why we created this together)

This handbook was created using materials from the [Our Handbook project website](https://very-good-science.github.io/our-handbook).

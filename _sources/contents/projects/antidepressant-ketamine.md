# Mechanisms of the sustained antidepressant effects of ketamine

This project led by [Joe Flanagan](../our-team/members/joeflanagan) aims to better understand the sustained 
antidepressant effects of ketamine and NMDA receptor antagonist.

My PhD project aims to employ ex vivo brain slice electrophysiology and single-cell RNA sequencing to 
characterise the molecular and synaptic mechanisms underlying ketamine's sustained antidepressant 
effects in the rodent medial prefrontal cortex. 
This will hopefully inspire future drug discovery into ketamine analogues 
with sustained antidepressant effects and a reduced side effect burden.


### Aim:
We aim to investigate synaptic and circuit alterations within the medial prefrontal cortex
in response to ketamine administration to help us better understand its sustained antidepressant effects.

This will hopefully inspire future drug discovery into ketamine analogues 
with sustained antidepressant effects and a reduced side effect burden.

### Techniques:
To achieve these goals, I am using ex vivo brain slice electrophysiology in the mPFC to measure synaptic plasticity mechanisms 
whilst characterising, at the subcellular level, the changes in transcriptomics with single-cell RNA sequencing.

# Bristol neuroscience data guide

This project led by `Martynas Dervinis` and involving multiple neuroscience research groups as well as Bristol's [Advanced Computing Research Centre](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/acrc/) aims to create an open access and user friendly way to share and access large data sets that are becoming more common in modern neuroscience. 




### Open access data sharing:

Recent advances in scientific techniques have led to the generation of large multidimensional datasets.
With open access science such a priority scientists need easy, cost effective, and user-friendly ways 
to make data accessible to collaborators and the public.

[Bristol neuroscience data guide](https://mellor-lab.github.io/bristol-neuroscience-data-guide/intro.html) aims to provide a framework for open source storage and sharing of neuroscience data.
We have created guides and tutorials to encourage consistent data file structures and storage, to facilitate data sharing. 
Alongside this we have been developing a data sharing platform based on the storage architecture of [GIN](https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki) to be used by Bristol Neuroscience research teams.

We hope that by facilitating the sharing of datasets ongoing development of [Bristol GIN](https://mellor-lab.github.io/bristol-neuroscience-data-guide/intro.html#welcome-bristol-gin) will lead to its use by any science research discipline within and beyond the University of Bristol.

# GluK2 editing in maintaining neuronal networks

This project is led by [Jithin Nair](../our-team/members/jithinnair) in collaboration with Jeremy Henley's group aims to understand 
how GluK2 Q/R editing radically alters the KAR properties and neuronal networks

### Aim:
We aim to study the role that that GluK2 Q/R editing has on its ionotropic/metabotropic signalling. 
recently we identified that GluK2 Q/R editing influences the ionotropic/metabotropic balance of 
KAR signalling and regulates synaptic expression of AMPARs and plasticity [Nair et al. 2022](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.31.514576v1.full)

On going work aims to investigate how this might be implicated in neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders.

### Techniques:
For these projects we use a combination of biochemical techniques paired with whole-cell patch clamp recordings to be able
to study the direct links between structure and function of these receptors.

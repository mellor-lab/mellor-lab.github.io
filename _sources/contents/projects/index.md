# Our Projects

We have a range of projects within our group spanning from the molecular level to the systems level, with collaboration a key to our success
we utalise a range of methodology including:
- Brain slice electrophysiology 
- 2photon calcium imaging in brain slices
- Head fixed virtual reality with 2photon calcium imaging 
- Molecular Biochemistry 
- Animal behavioor
- Computational modelling 
- in vivo calcium imaging with minaturised microscopes

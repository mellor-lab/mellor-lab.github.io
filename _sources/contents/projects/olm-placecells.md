# OLM interneurons regulation of placecells

This project lead by [matt udakis](../our-team/members/mattudakis) aims to investigate how OLM interneurons
regulate placecell activity, formation and stability in the hippocampus.

### Aim:
We aim to investigate how OLM interneurons may regulate the plasticity mechanisms used to form place cells and maintain their stability over multiple environements

### Techinques:
We use in vivo calcium imaging to record from CA1 place cells whilst animals explore familar and novel environments over multiple days
we are combining this with optogentic tools to peterb OLM inhibitory interneurons during exploration. 
In vivo work is complemented by brain slice 2photon microscopy to understand the potential role these interneurons have in controlling place cell plasticity at a dendritic level.
